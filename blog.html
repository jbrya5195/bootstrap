    <h2>Black History reincarnated</h2>
    <p><p>It was previously reported that the Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole collaboration album is still in the works but the two artists are focusing primarily on their individual careers. However, a new report from Complex hints that the album is being delayed because of an upcoming summer tour that will see J. Cole and Drake team up.

"There's a rumor that I heard that there's gonna be an announcement this week of a Drake and J. Cole summer tour," stated Ebro Darden of Hot 97. Unfortunately, neither Drake nor J. Cole's camp was able to verify if this statement was true or not. </p></p>
